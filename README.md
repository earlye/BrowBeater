# BrowBeater

I'm a huge fan of MultiBrowser for Mac:
http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33861/multibrowser

Unfortunately, it isn't available on Windows, and appears to have been
abandoned even on OSX. It still installs as of this writing (El
Capitan), but the System Preferences panel no longer works.

So, I figured I could either bitch and moan about that, or I could
write my own. I've been itching to see what's new with Qt, so I
figured I'd download the latest Qt Creator (3.6.1), the latest Qt
(5.6.0), and see if I could pull it off.

And now, I've got the Mac version (mostly) working.

### BACK LOG:

* Figure out how to register Brow Beater as a browser on mac

* Make sure that clicking a link outside BrowBeater will launch
  BrowBeater, and that the user can then use BrowBeater to launch
  other browsers.

* Write Windows platform code.

* Write Linux platform code.

* Make the UI not so... F!@#$ ugly.
